# Paperblossom-Community-Files
Community made files to flesh out paperblossom

Current main file being worked on is user_descriptions.csv as some of the tools required to add some items have to be
written into the code.

Recommended editor is DB Browser for SQLite
https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

Please when working on files use the branch meant for that book.

CORE = Core Book


(OP) = Opportunities
