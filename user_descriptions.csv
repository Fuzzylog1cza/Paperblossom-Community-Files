"Soul Sunder","While bushi are generally less well equipped to deal with supernatural threats than shugenja, mastery of any art reveals how the world is all interconnected.

"Striking as Air","Not every stroke a warrior throws in battle is intended to kill—even if they all lead to that end goal. A skilled fighter can tell when an attack will not land and subtly shift it into a different sort of attack, meant to probe the enemy’s defenses or draw their guard out of position.

"Striking as Fire","Victory cannot be achieved through defense alone, and it is a poor student of the sword who forgets that their most important goal is simple: cut down their enemy.

This effect persists until the end of your next turn.%0A","Rank 1"
"Striking as Void","The future is part of Void’s domain, infinite in possibility and unfathomable in depth. Because of its formlessness, one cannot scheme to undermine the uncertain future but the instant it takes shape, an action is vulnerable to countermeasures. The bushi rests until the last possible second, allowing the potential energy of their strike to take shape only after it is too late for their enemy to respond.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee, Ranged, or Unarmed] (Void) check, you may spend (OP) in the following ways:%0A%0AVoid (OP): Immediately switch to a different stance of your choice.%0AVoid (OP): If you fail, you may perform another action. This must be an action you have not yet performed this turn. You can only activate this opportunity once per round.","Rank 5"
"Striking as Water","The finest armor is useless if a warrior can bypass it, slipping a blade through the gaps that allow the wearer to move or using blunt, concussive force to create a space.

"Tactical Assessment","Akodo’s Leadership and Bayushi’s Lies agree on a few topics, for both leaders were practical to a certain degree, even if Akodo famously scorned many of Bayushi’s methods. As the scholar Hida Fuyuko noted in her revelatory commentary on Leadership’s lessons for commanders on the Kaiu Wall, the most famous meeting of these two minds comes on the matter of preparation: battles are not won in the field, but in the leadup to the conflict. Even in small clashes, the warrior who better understands the terrain, the strength of their own forces, and the composition of the enemy’s troops is usually victorious.%0A%0AActivation: When you make an Initiative check, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0AAir (OP): Choose an enemy in the conflict.

Until the end of their first turn, they apply that advantage to all of their checks.","Rank 2"
"Warrior’s Resolve","The bushi draws a deep breath, exhaling as they rise to their feet. Pain can be conquered as long as there is a duty to be done.

Your target cannot defend against this damage if they are Compromised.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0A(OP): Ready one other sheathed Razor-Edged weapon.","Rank 2"
"Iron Forest Style","A bushi versed in the spear can control their spacing with their opponent, forcing their foe to risk impalement each time they advance or catching loose clothes or stray body parts on the head of the weapon. Akodo’s Leadership refers to such a technique as the Iron Forest style, which turns the length of a single spear into an insurmountable distance.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee] check using a polearm, you may spend (OP) in the following way: %0A%0A(OP)+: The area in range of your weapon counts as Dan- gerous terrain for one target of your action per (OP) spent this way.

This effect persists until the start of your next turn.","Rank 2"

Targets of silhouette 3 or greater may resist with a TN 3 Fitness check and ignore this effect if they succeed.","Rank 2"
"Rushing Avalanche Style","When adopting this style, the bushi strikes with reckless abandon using a heavy armament.

"Spinning Blades Style","The biggest advantage of dual wielding does not usually stem from striking with two weapons simultaneously, largely because this is a very difficult feat. Instead, it comes from the fact that the warrior does not need to sacrifice defense while attacking or offense while defending. The off-hand blade can deflect and threaten even as the main-hand weapon attacks, or the bushi can strike with the offhand weapon while the main-hand weapon is locked with the foe’s blade. Either weapon can deliver death, and so the enemy must watch both at all times.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee] or Martial Arts [Unarmed] Attack action check, if you have a second readied weapon you did not use for the attack, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0A(OP)+: You must spend (OP) equal to your target’s Vigilance to activate this technique.

"Veiled Menace Style","Assassination and other clandestine tactics are frowned upon by many samurai. None can deny the effectiveness of such techniques, however. By drawing their enemy’s gaze away from the true threat, a bushi can often tip the scales against a strong foe.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee] or Martial Arts [Unarmed] Attack action check using a weapon in a one-handed grip, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0A(OP)+: If you succeed, choose one unaware or Disoriented target of your action.

Skilled practitioners often maintain this technique, twisting the wind around them to steal away pernicious words and wicked prayers alike.%0A%0AActivation: As a Scheme and Support action, you may activate this kihō, you may make a TN 1 Theology (Air) check to create an area of silence around you. %0A%0AEnhancement Effect: If you succeed, this kihō acti- vates. While this kihō is active, increase the TN of Scheme action checks targeting you by one plus your ranks in Command.%0A%0ABurst Effect: If you have two or more bonus successes, characters at range 0–3 suffer the Silenced condition (see page 273) and cannot hear. This effect persists until the beginning of your next turn.","Rank 1"
"Way of the Willow","The oak stands firm against the storm and breaks, but the willow survives it by bending. The monk dances on the wind like the willow, feeling the currents of ki upon the air and moving out of the way of attacks effortlessly.%0A%0AActivation: As a Movement and Support action, you may make a TN 3 Meditation (Air) check to adjust your defenses to the tempo of your foes’ strikes, mak- ing yourself much harder to hit.%0A%0AEnhancement Effect: If you succeed, this kihō acti- vates. While this kihō is active, when a character per- forms an Attack action check targeting you, reduce any damage you suffer by 2 for each kept die containing (EXSuc). %0A%0ABurst Effect: If you have two or more bonus successes, increase the TN of Attack action checks targeting you by your ranks in Meditation until the beginning of your next turn.","Rank 3"
"Breaking Blow","A kihō practitioner skilled in aligning their energy to the element of Fire can deliver a strike that forces a spark of ki into an object and ignites the latent energy within; causing the object to explode or shatter.%0A%0AActivation: As an Attack and Support action, you may make a TN 1 Martial Arts [Unarmed] (Fire) check to enhance your unarmed blows. When you perform this action, you may choose one object at range 0–1 as the target for the burst effect.%0A%0AEnhancement Effect: If you succeed, this kihō activates. While this kihō is active, when you succeed at a Martial Arts [Unarmed] check against a target, choose one worn piece of armor or readied weapon in one target’s possession. It gains the Damaged quality (see page 240) unless the target chooses to receive 2 fatigue.%0A%0ABurst Effect: If you have two or more bonus successes, the chosen object gains the Damaged quality (see page 240). At the GM’s discretion, this can also be used to shatter tough mundane objects, such as woo en doors, earthen walls, and trees. If you have four or more bonus successes, the chosen object gains the Destroyed quality instead. At the GM’s discretion, this can be used to destroy even reinforced mundane objects, such as metal doors and stone walls.","Rank 1"
"Blessed Wind","The shugenja recites a short chant, and the dust whips up, carried upon twisting currents of air that foil and deflect projectiles. Stones, arrows, and even larger missiles are knocked aside by buffeting winds, keeping the target safe from such attacks.%0A%0AActivation: As a Support action, you may make a TN 2 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 0–3.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon a swirling wind at the target position. Any character at range 0–2 of the chosen position counts as being in Obscuring terrain (see Terrain, on page 267) for the purposes of Attack actions targeting them. This effect persists for one round, plus additional rounds equal to your bonus successes.%0A%0ANew Oppurtunities%0AAir (OP): This effect persists until the end of the scene instead.","Rank 1"
"By the Light of the Lord Moon","When a shugenja performs this invocation, the light shifts to that of a moonlit night, unweaving the shadows to lay bare the things they conceal. Hidden objects glow faintly with silver light, while mystical illusions are revealed as translucent, gossamer forms.%0A%0AActivation: As a Scheme action, you may make a TN 2 Theology (Air) check targeting an area at range 0–2 of you.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you scry for each hidden character and concealed object (such as secret compartments, trap doors, and concealed weapons) in the targeted area, revealing it with an illusory, luminous outline that only you can perceive. This invocation only reveals objects and people concealed by mundane means.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP)+: If you succeed, you may also reveal up to one magically concealed object per (OP) spent this way.%0AAir (OP) (OP)+: Choose one additional character at range 0–1 per (OP) (OP) spent this way. The chosen characters can also see the objects.","Rank 1"
"Call Upon the Wind","The shugenja whispers a breathless prayer and rises from the ground as gentle winds bear them aloft. Air spirits usually carry their charges gracefully, without dropping them to stumble the last few feet—usually.%0A%0AActivation: As a Movement action, you may make a TN 4 Theology (Air) check targeting yourself.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you augment your movement with a gust of wind that carries you aloft. In addition to being able to move vertically freely, you ignore the effects of terrain while flying. This effect persists until the end of the scene.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP) (OP)+: While flying, you may carry up to one additional willing character at range 0–2 with you per (OP) (OP) spent this way.","Rank 2"
"Cloak of Night","A sufficiently learned shugenja can call forth air kami to play one of their simplest and most effective tricks: enveloping an object or person in their embrace to hide it from sight.%0A%0AActivation: As a Scheme and Support action, you may make a Theology (Air) check targeting one object or character at range 0–1. The TN is equal to the target’s silhouette (see page 265).%0AEffects: If you succeed, you augment the target with an illusion that renders it invisible to the naked eye. The object is still physically present and can be touched, smelled, or sensed with any normal sense other than vision. This effect persists for one round, plus additional rounds equal to your bonus successes.%0A%0ANew Oppurtunities%0AAir (OP) (OP)+: Choose one additional target of the same silhouette or smaller per (OP) (OP) spent this way.","Rank 1"
"False Realm of the Fox Spirits","The kami are not bound so tightly to the Mortal Realm of Ningen-dō as mortals (even shugenja) are. They can see the ways in which the mortal and spiritual realms overlap and disconnect, and when beseeched by a shugenja, they can even draw visions of one realm into another, creating vast, nearly tangible falsehoods that fool all but the keenest observers.%0A%0AActivation: As a Scheme action, you may make a TN 5 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 0–4.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon illusory terrain at the target position that extends out a number of range bands up to your Air Ring. A character unaware of the illusion’s false nature must resist with a TN 4 Survival check (Earth 5, Fire 2) to realize its falsehood at a distance. As the illusion has no substance, any physical contact reveals the lie (though the illusion stays in place). This effect persists for a number of rounds equal to your Air Ring plus your bonus successes (or that many minutes during a narrative or downtime scene).%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): This effect persists until the end of the scene instead.%0AAir (OP)+: The illusory terrain you summon has one of the following terrain qualities per  spent this way: Dangerous, Entangling, or Obscuring (see Terrain, on page 267).","Rank 4"
"Grasp of the Air Dragon","The shugenja exhales a long breath at the end of the incantation and extends a hand. A stillness descends, the moment before the storm breaks. Then, the clouds high above twist and trail from the Heavens like festival streamers. The wind swoops toward the target and hurls them into the air—carrying them to safety or to their doom, depending on the will of the shugenja.%0A%0AActivation: As an Attack action or a Support action, you may make a TN 4 Theology (Air) check targeting one character at range 3–5.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon a gale-force wind to move the target a number of range bands equal to your Air Ring plus your bonus successes (to a maximum of 6 range bands), ignoring any intervening terrain. You may choose to set the target down on the ground gently (if you chose Support action) or slam them into it with full force (if you chose Attack action). When you slam a target to the ground this way, the target must resist with a TN 4 Fitness check (Earth 5, Fire 2) or suffer the effects of a fall from range 3 (see Falling on page 269).%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP)+: Treat the maximum range of this technique as 1 higher per (OP) spent this way.%0AAir (OP) (OP)+: Increase the height of the fall the target suffers by 1 per (OP) (OP) spent this way.","Rank 3"
"Mask of Wind","Deception is not the way of the samurai, but it is often the way of expedience. The shugenja asks the air kami to mask their features and even their voice, causing onlookers to perceive a different person.%0A%0AActivation: As a Scheme and Support action, you may make a TN 3 Theology (Air) check targeting yourself.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you augment yourself with an illusion that makes you look like someone else. An observer must resist with a TN 4 Sentiment check (Earth 5, Fire 2) to notice something amiss from your appearance alone; if they succeed, they may spend (OP) to recognize you specifically. This effect persists until the end of the scene.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): You may alter your voice to sound like someone else while the illusion is in place. An observer must resist with a TN 4 Sentiment check (Earth 5, Fire 2) to notice something amiss from the sound of your voice alone, and they may spend (OP) if they succeed to recognize you specifically.%0AAir (OP) (OP)+: This effect persists for one additional scene per (OP) (OP) spent this way.","Rank 2"
"Nature's Touch","To perform this rite, the shugenja seeks Chikushō-dō, the Realm of Animals, in the world around them and in their own heart. This allows the shugenja to communicate with (though not dominate) animals of the mortal realm.%0A%0AActivation: As a Support action, you may make a TN 1 Theology (Air) check targeting yourself.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you augment yourself with the ability to speak to animals of the natural world (but not Otherworldly or Tainted beings). Animals can understand you (within their ability to do so, naturally— human political relationships will have no meaning to horses, no matter how many times you explain them). They are not compelled to obey you, however. This effect persists until the end of the scene.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): Until the end of the scene, you can understand animals’ speech.%0AAir (OP): If you succeed, the animal also acts favorably toward you automatically due to your politeness, fulfilling one request that does not put it in danger without having to be convinced with bribes of food or subsequent checks.%0AAir (OP) (OP): If you succeed, you can communicate with an Otherworldly being this way, provided it has anything to say to you.","Rank 1"
"Rise, Air","A manifest air kami is a flickering, shifting thing, a whirlwind of power with lashing arms that screams with the voice of the storm. It towers above the tallest of humans, yet can find its way through the slightest of cracks. The slightest slip of concentration while guiding such a being can lead to untold devastation as the child of the tempest carves its way across the landscape.%0A%0AActivation: As a Support action, you may make a TN 6 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 3–5.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon a Manifest Air Kami (see page 322) to fight for you. It appears at the target position and obeys you for two rounds, plus additional rounds equal to your bonus successes, taking its turn immediately after yours each round. When this effect ends, it departs or, if stirred to particular ire, begins to follow its own directives. If it begins to act independently, it does not attack the shugenja who summoned it unless provoked.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): The manifest air kami arrives in a cyclone that hurls aside anything nearby. Each character at range 0–2 of the target position must resist with a TN 4 Fitness check (Earth 5, Fire 2) or suffer supernatural damage equal to your Air Ring and be pushed away 2 range bands.","Rank 4"
"Secrets on the Wind","The spirits of air need little prompting to gossip, even if their breathless murmurs are often incomprehensible to human ears. To make this clandestine invocation, the shugenja offers up incense of sandalwood and plum to convince the air kami to repeat what is said far away.%0A%0AActivation: As a Scheme action, you may make a TN 3 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 0.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you scry with whispering winds that eavesdrop on the chosen position. The air kami can overhear anything said within a number of range bands equal to your Air Ring. This effect persists for twenty-four hours or until you designate a new area for eavesdropping. While this effect persists, you may spend an action to hear anything being said at the moment in the designated area.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): In addition to hearing things in the designated area, you can also smell any scents in that area.%0AAir (OP): If another character discovers your invocation, the effect immediately ends, preventing them from identifying it as your handiwork.%0AAir (OP) (OP)+: The effect persists for twenty-four additional hours per (OP) (OP) spent this way.","Rank 2"
"Summon Fog","Tendrils of mist spill forth from the character’s robes or armor, billowing out before them and wrapping them in an ominous haze.%0A%0AActivation: As a Support action, you may make a TN 2 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 0–4.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon a fog bank that fills an area extending 1 range band around the target position. This fog bank counts as Obscuring terrain (see Terrain, on page 267).%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): You may choose a character instead of a position. The fog bank follows that character.%0AAir (OP)+: The fog bank encompasses 1 additional range band per  spent this way (to a maximum of range 6).%0AAir (OP) (OP): The fog bank becomes a freezing ice storm, causing it to become Dangerous terrain as well.","Rank 2"
"Tempest of Air","The shugenja beseeches the air spirits to lash out all around them, calling buffeting winds to push foes backward or even hurl them to the ground.%0A%0AActivation: As an Attack action, you may make a TN 3 Theology (Air) check targeting each character at range 2–3.%0AEffects: If you succeed, blasts of wind smite each target. Each target suffers supernatural damage equal to your Air Ring and must resist with a TN 4 Fitness check (Earth 5, Fire 2) or suffer the Disoriented condition.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP)+: Each target who fails their Fitness check is also pushed 1 range band away from you per (OP) spent this way.","Rank 1"
"Token of Memory","After performing this invocation, the shugenja conjures an illusion from the air, a trick of the light captured in hand.%0A%0AActivation: As a Scheme action, you may make a TN 2 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 0–1.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon an illusion of one inanimate object at the target position. The illusory object’s size is a silhouette of up to your bonus successes (beginning at 0, or a small handheld object). The item appears real, but it does not actually exist, and it cannot be used. Any character confronted with one of these illusions must resist with a TN 4 Artisan, Smithing, or Design check (Earth 5, Fire 2) using a Scholar skill approach to discern its illusory nature. The object persists until the end of the scene.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): The object can appear to be a creature or person (though it does not move).%0AAir (OP)+: Summon one additional illusory object in range per (OP) spent this way.%0AAir (OP) (OP): Illusory objects you summon this way have mass, and they can be used as if they were real (though they are still inanimate, and thus do not move on their own). They still vanish when the effect ends.","Rank 1"
"Vapor of Nightmares","The shugenja murmurs an incantation half-heard by the target, and as the ominous chant fades and the scent cloud of incense parts, the object of the target’s fear strides forth as an illusive phantasm.%0A%0AActivation: As an Attack action, you may make a TN 4 Theology (Air) check targeting one character at range 2–3.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon an illusion of your target’s greatest fear. Your target must resist with a TN 4 Meditation check (Earth 5, Fire 2) to see through against this phantasm; if they fail, they suffer strife equal to your Air Ring plus your bonus successes, and must immediately unmask if they become Compromised this way. If they unmask in the presence of the phantasm, they focus their attentions on the phantasm, attacking it, fleeing from it, or unleashing harsh words upon it (rather than dealing with you or anyone else). The phantasm persists for a number of rounds equal to your Air Ring.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): If a target fails the Meditation check, they also suffer the Disoriented condition.%0AAir (OP): The phantasm persists until the end of the scene instead.","Rank 3"
"Wrath of Kaze-no-Kami","When stirred to wrath through the deepest secrets of the shugenja’s art, the spirits of the wind become a howling tornado, spinning around the priest and raising them from the ground while devastating everything in reach; uprooting trees, shattering buildings, and crushing foes.%0A%0AActivation: As an Attack action, you may make a TN 5 Theology (Air) check targeting each character at range 2–4.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon a hurricane that buffets all characters in range. At the end of each of your turns, each target in range must resist with a TN 4 Fitness check (Earth 5, Fire 2) or suffer supernatural damage equal to your Air Ring and suffer the Disoriented condition. The hurricane persists for a number of rounds equal to your Air Ring and can destroy objects or structures at your GM's discretion.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): You may end the hurricane at any time as an action.%0AAir (OP)+: If you succeed, each target who fails the Fitness check at the end of this turn is hurled a number of range bands away from you equal to (OP) spent this way. Upon landing, each target hurled this way suffers the negative effects of falling the number of range bands they moved (see Falling on page 269).%0AAir (OP) (OP): While within the hurricane, you can fly, moving vertically and ignoring the effects of terrain.","Rank 5"
"Yari of Air","The shugenja adopts a spear-fighting stance, and a swirling, darting mass ripples into being in their hand. It weighs almost nothing and yet strikes with the force of a thunderclap.%0A%0AActivation: As a Support action, you may make a TN 1 Theology (Air) check to summon a spear made of swirling wind into your hand.%0AEffects: If you succeed, you summon and ready a spear (see Weapons, on page 230) made of wind, visible only by a wispy outline. It has the Concealable quality. When you make an Attack or Support action check using the invisible spear, during Step 5: Choose Kept Dice, add a kept (RNG) set to an (OP) result. The spear persists until the end of any turn in which it leaves your grip or until the end of the encounter, at which point it dissipates into wind.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0AAir (OP): The weapon you summon can be any kind of melee or ranged weapon instead of a spear.%0AAir (OP): After performing this action, you may immediately perform a Guard action using the weapon you summoned.%0AAir (OP) (OP): You may summon a pair of weapons instead of a single weapon.","Rank 1"
