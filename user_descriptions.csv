Crescent Moon Style,"Striking first is valuable, but so is surviving. To defend without sacrificing offense, a bushi must be ready to retaliate swiftly after blocking or evading.

Flowing Water Strike,"A skilled warrior is not restricted by the optimal range of their weapon, and can open or close gaps to compensate for positional disadvantages.%0A%0AActivation: As an Attack and Movement action using a readied weapon, you may make a TN 3 Martial Arts (Water) check using the appropriate skill for that readied weapon, targeting one character at range 0–2 (regardless of the weapon’s usual range restrictions). %0A%0AEffects: If you succeed, the target suffers physical damage equal to your Water Ring and suffers the Bleeding condition.

Disappearing World Style,"Seeing nothing but their enemy, the bushi surges forward in a flurry of strikes, seeking to land a hit to the eyes, temple, or other vulnerable area rapidly after their initial attack.

Lord Hida’s Grip,"The Kami Hida, patron of the Crab Clan, was a legendary slayer of monsters. He beheaded the massive demon that once menaced the rosemarble palace, and ripped out one skull of the two-headed Kabuto no Oni and crushed the other head with it.

Lord Shiba’s Valor,"Once, in the Shadowlands, the Kami Shiba stood alone between a vast horde of its foul denizens and the last of the Seven Thunders after their victory against Fu Leng. Drawing the legendary sword Ofushikai, Shiba cut his way through the host to the First Oni.

Soul Sunder,"While bushi are generally less well equipped to deal with supernatural threats than shugenja, mastery of any art reveals how the world is all interconnected. Warriors deeply engaged with the mysteries of the sword can attune themselves to their ancestral blades to cut even those beings who walk between worlds and whose flesh steel normally will not bite.%0A%0AActivation: As a Support action, you may make a TN 4 Meditation (Void) check to attune your blade to the spirits of your honored ancestors.%0A%0AEffects: If you succeed, choose one readied weapon.

Striking as Air,"Not every stroke a warrior throws in battle is intended to kill—even if they all lead to that end goal. A skilled fighter can tell when an attack will not land and subtly shift it into a different sort of attack, meant to probe the enemy’s defenses or draw their guard out of position. By carefully placing attack after attack, a master of the blade can eventually whittle down their opponent’s options until none remain but death.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee, Ranged, or Unarmed] (Air) check, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0AAir (OP)+: Reserve one of your rolled dice, plus one additional die per (OP) (OP) spent this way.

Striking as Fire,"Victory cannot be achieved through defense alone, and it is a poor student of the sword who forgets that their most important goal is simple: cut down their enemy. All else fades to the background as the bushi fiercely presses the attack, trying to force an error or open an opportunity to end their foe.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee, Ranged, or Unarmed] (Fire) Attack action check, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0AFire (OP)+: The next time your target suffers a critical strike, increase its severity by 1 per (OP) spent this way. This effect persists until the end of your next turn.",Rank 1
Striking as Void,"The future is part of Void’s domain, infinite in possibility and unfathomable in depth. Because of its formlessness, one cannot scheme to undermine the uncertain future but the instant it takes shape, an action is vulnerable to countermeasures. The bushi rests until the last possible second, allowing the potential energy of their strike to take shape only after it is too late for their enemy to respond.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee, Ranged, or Unarmed] (Void) check, you may spend (OP) in the following ways:%0A%0AVoid (OP): Immediately switch to a different stance of your choice.%0AVoid (OP): If you fail, you may perform another action. This must be an action you have not yet performed this turn. You can only activate this opportunity once per round.",Rank 5
Striking as Water,"The finest armor is useless if a warrior can bypass it, slipping a blade through the gaps that allow the wearer to move or using blunt, concussive force to create a space.

This effect persists until the end of your next turn.",Rank 1
Tactical Assessment,"Akodo’s Leadership and Bayushi’s Lies agree on a few topics, for both leaders were practical to a certain degree, even if Akodo famously scorned many of Bayushi’s methods. As the scholar Hida Fuyuko noted in her revelatory commentary on Leadership’s lessons for commanders on the Kaiu Wall, the most famous meeting of these two minds comes on the matter of preparation: battles are not won in the field, but in the leadup to the conflict. Even in small clashes, the warrior who better understands the terrain, the strength of their own forces, and the composition of the enemy’s troops is usually victorious.%0A%0AActivation: When you make an Initiative check, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0AAir (OP): Choose an enemy in the conflict.

Until the end of their first turn, they apply that advantage to all of their checks.",Rank 2
Warrior’s Resolve,"The bushi draws a deep breath, exhaling as they rise to their feet. Pain can be conquered as long as there is a duty to be done.

Your target cannot defend against this damage if they are Compromised.%0A%0ANew Opportunities%0A(OP): Ready one other sheathed Razor-Edged weapon.",Rank 2
Iron Forest Style,"A bushi versed in the spear can control their spacing with their opponent, forcing their foe to risk impalement each time they advance or catching loose clothes or stray body parts on the head of the weapon. Akodo’s Leadership refers to such a technique as the Iron Forest style, which turns the length of a single spear into an insurmountable distance.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee] check using a polearm, you may spend (OP) in the following way: %0A%0A(OP)+: The area in range of your weapon counts as Dan- gerous terrain for one target of your action per (OP) spent this way.

This effect persists until the start of your next turn.",Rank 2
Open-Hand Style,"Power does not come from speed alone. A master martial artist can apply force for maximum effect, making even gentle movements devastatingly effective blocks and strikes.

Targets of silhouette 3 or greater may resist with a TN 3 Fitness check and ignore this effect if they succeed.",Rank 2
Rushing Avalanche Style,"When adopting this style, the bushi strikes with reckless abandon using a heavy armament.

Spinning Blades Style,"The biggest advantage of dual wielding does not usually stem from striking with two weapons simultaneously, largely because this is a very difficult feat. Instead, it comes from the fact that the warrior does not need to sacrifice defense while attacking or offense while defending. The off-hand blade can deflect and threaten even as the main-hand weapon attacks, or the bushi can strike with the offhand weapon while the main-hand weapon is locked with the foe’s blade. Either weapon can deliver death, and so the enemy must watch both at all times.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee] or Martial Arts [Unarmed] Attack action check, if you have a second readied weapon you did not use for the attack, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0A(OP)+: You must spend (OP) equal to your target’s Vigilance to activate this technique.

Veiled Menace Style,"Assassination and other clandestine tactics are frowned upon by many samurai. None can deny the effectiveness of such techniques, however. By drawing their enemy’s gaze away from the true threat, a bushi can often tip the scales against a strong foe.%0A%0AActivation: When you make a Martial Arts [Melee] or Martial Arts [Unarmed] Attack action check using a weapon in a one-handed grip, you may spend (OP) in the following way:%0A%0A(OP)+: If you succeed, choose one unaware or Disoriented target of your action.

Pin the Fan,"While it is difficult to kill at range with a single arrow, it can certainly be done, and master archers have been performing legendary feats of precision since the early days of Rokugan.
